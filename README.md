## **code**
**There are three R code files in this folder**
- **data_clean.R** Visualize data, remove weird data points and outlier
- **lasso.R**      Use Lasso method to do variable selection and constructs linear models to predict BodyFat%
- **stepwise.R**   Construct multiple linear models to predict BodyFat%, diagnose model and test robustness


## **data**
**Two filse are included in this folder**
